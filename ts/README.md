## 0. Setup

Install [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Choose the Long Time Support (LTS) version --not the current version with latest features.
- download the `.pkg` file from the website
- duoble click on the `.pkg` file to install it

Install typescript, via `npm` (node package manager): open a terminal and type in:
- `npm install -g typescript` on windows and linux
- `sudo npm install -g typescript` on mac

(the `-g` command is for a global install on your computer)

## 1. ts basics
ts was originally developped by microsoft, and is now used widely (by google notably).

ts is a superset of js: any valid js code is valid ts code. But ts comes in with many more interesting features. In particular it is object oriented.

You get compile-time erros in ts, rather than run-time errors in js: you may spot errors before running your code.

**Compilation and run**:
- transcribe ts code into js by executing `tsc mytsfile.ts` at the command line: this converts your code into js in a new file (`mytsfile.js` here)
- you can run the `.js` file with node by executing `node mytsfile.js` at the command line.

Like in js, any statement has to end up with a semi-colon (`;`), and use `//` for comments.

## 2. ts variables
Use `let` to define variables in ts. As is js your variables --unless globally declared-- will have block scope.

You can declare types in ts (and you should).
```ts
let a: number; // integer or floating point number
a = 1;
a = 'blabla'; // compilation error!
let b: boolean;
let c: string = "hello"; // optional initialisation
let d: any; // any type, will be assigned when you assign a value
```
If a variable is declared with `any` type, you can use type assertion to set its type like in this example:
```ts
let msg;
msg = 'abc';
let oneWay = (<string>msg).replace('a','b');
let alternativeWay = (msg as string).replace('a','b');
```

Arrays are defined similarly:
```ts
let e: number[]; // array of numbers
let f: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; // optional initialisation
let i: any[] = [1, true, 'a']; // avoid, this is not good practice.
```
Like in js, your can declare constant variables with `const`.


<a name="tsfn"></a>
## 3. ts functions
ts functions are defined like this:
```ts
let doLog0 = function(message: string){
  console.log(message);
};
```
or with an "arrow" like this:
```ts
let doLog1 = (message) => {
  console.log(message);
};
let doLog2 = (message) => console.log(message); // for one line functions only
```
If a function does not return anything like in the above examples, it is of `void` type

Like in js, use the `return` keyword to return something, for example:
```ts
let mySearch = function(source: string, subString: string) {
    let result = source.search(subString);
    return result > -1; // return type is boolean
};
```

<a name="tsint"></a>
## 4. ts interfaces
Interfaces allow you to define custom made objects, like for instance:
```ts
interface SimplePoint{
  y: number,
  z?: number // this is an optional property
}
```
We use *Pascal convention*: objects and custom types are capitalized (here `SimplePoint`).

You can also define function types in an interface, declaring only its type (the type of what it returns - `void` in case it doesn't return anything), and the types of its arguments:
```ts
interface SearchFunc {
    (source: string, subString: string): boolean;
}
```
and you would call such a method like this:
```ts
let mySearch: SearchFunc;
mySearch = function(source: string, subString: string) {
    let result = source.search(subString);
    return result > -1;
}
```
The implementations of such properties and methods is not done within the interface. The interface is simply like a "shape".

<a name="tsclass"></a>
## 5. ts classes
Classes allow you to define custom made objects, and --unlike interfaces-- contain implementation details of their properties and methods.
In addition a class have a special method, called a **constructor** which we use set up initial values of class properties.
Example:
```ts
class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
    printGreeting(){
        console.log(this.greet());
    }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("guys!\n How are you doing?");
```
In the last line we construct an instance of the Greeter class using `new`. This calls into the constructor we defined earlier, creating a new object with the `Greeter` shape, and running the constructor to initialize it.

You can call the methods of your object by appending `.nameOfMethod()` to its name, here for example: `greeter.printGreeting();`.

By default, properties and methods are **public**: you can access them from any instanciated object of the class.
You might want some properties and methods to be **private** to add private functionality into your classes. What are private properties or methods? A private property or method can only be accessed or called from the class instance itself. Letâ€™s take a look at an example of private properties:
```ts
class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    private politeness: string = "Dear Sir or Madam";
    private forbiddenWords: string[] = ['dude', 'idiot', 'moron', 'stupid'];

    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
    printGreeting(){
        console.log(this.greet());
    }
    // this is a 'getter': to access a private property
    getPoliteness() {
        return this.politeness;
    }
    // this is a 'setter': to modify a private property
    setPoliteness(polite: string){
        let noCurse: boolean = true;
        for (let curse of this.forbiddenWords){
            noCurse = noCurse && (polite.search(curse) == -1);
        }
        if(noCurse){
            this.politeness = polite;
        } else {
            throw new Error('politeness update refused: inapropriate language!');
        }
    }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("Eric Marshal");
greeter.politeness; // Error: 'politeness' is private;
console.log(greeter.getPoliteness()); // prints out "Dir Sir or Madam"
greeter.setPoliteness("My dear friend"); // updates 'politeness'
greeter.setPoliteness("What's up dude!?); // Error: politeness update refused: inapropriate language!
```
As you can see `private` hides the property from the user/consumer of the class. If you try to set `greeter.politeness` you get an error.
