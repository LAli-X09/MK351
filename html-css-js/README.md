### html basics

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
* HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
* HTML elements are represented by tags
* HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
* Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

A typical html page has the following structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
 
    <script>
      js functions can go here
    </script>
    
  </body>
</html>
```
